# Server Scripts
This is a collection of scripts (shell/bash mainly), that I've created to automate tasks that I find myself doing over-and-over again.

# Important!
These are not supposed to be "proffesional" or foolproof at all, I simply made these to fix specific things for myself.<br>
I have added some user-friendliness to the scripts, and some comments. But the reason I share these is simply for people to copy them and change them as they please!

<b>These scripts have only been used/tested on ubuntu servers</b>
